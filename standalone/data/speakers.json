    "bio": "Victoria Ashley Villar received her B.S. in Physics from MIT in 2014 and her Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from Harvard University in 2020. She was formerly a Simons Junior Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University (2020-2021) and a faculty member at Penn State University (2021-2023), before joining the Harvard Astronomy faculty in 2023. Prof. Villar’s research interests include theoretical and observational studies of extragalactic transients, including core-collapse supernovae and kilonovae, development of statistical and deep learning methodologies for wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and Nancy Grace Roman Observatory. Prof. Ashley Villar is a Packard Fellow, RCSA Scialog Fellow and Harvard Aramont Fellow.",
    "relevance": "Prof. Villar is a prominent researcher from Harvard University in the use of data-driven methods in astronomy. She has made significant contributions to the field by developing statistical and deep learning methodologies to study chemical compositions of supernovae, stellar phenomena such as eruptions, mergers, and explosions, and detect celestial bodies in astronomical data. The invited talk will provide insight novel applications in the field of astronomy enabled by ML and deep learning, showcasing the potential of AI for astronomical data processing.",
