subsection{List of invited speakers}
\subsubsection*{Invited Speaker 1: Victoria Ashley Villar}

\begin{itemize}[parsep=1em]
\item \textbf{Brief biography}

Victoria Ashley Villar received her B.S. in Physics from MIT in 2014 and her Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from Harvard University in 2020. She was formerly a Simons Junior Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University (2020-2021) and a faculty member at Penn State University (2021-2023), before joining the Harvard Astronomy faculty in 2023. Prof. Villar’s research interests include theoretical and observational studies of extragalactic transients, including core-collapse supernovae and kilonovae, development of statistical and deep learning methodologies for wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and Nancy Grace Roman Observatory. Prof. Ashley Villar is a Packard Fellow, RCSA Scialog Fellow and Harvard Aramont Fellow.

\item \textbf{Relevance to workshop}

Prof. Villar is a prominent researcher from Harvard University in the use of data-driven methods in astronomy.
She has made significant contributions to the field by developing statistical and deep learning methodologies to study chemical compositions of supernovae, stellar phenomena such as eruptions, mergers, and explosions, and detect celestial bodies in astronomical data.

The invited talk will provide insight novel applications in the field of astronomy enabled by ML and deep learning, showcasing the potential of AI for astronomical data processing.

 \subsubsection*{Invited Speaker 2 (Industrial talk): David Rijlaarsdam}

\begin{itemize}[parsep=1em]
\item \textbf{Brief biography}

David Rijlaarsdam is Director of Space System Engineering for Ubotica Technologies, where he manages the Space System R\&D team and is involved as a System Engineer in several space missions. He has a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology with a specialization in Space System Engineering. David has previously been part of the Automation and Robotics Section of the European Space Agency where he researched relative navigation for spacecraft and has been part of the advanced architecture team of Intel Movidius, where he researched the application of AI for star identification algorithms.

\item \textbf{Relevance to workshop}

Ubotica Technologies contributed to integrate machine learning solutions for payload image processing in numerous satellite missions, such as ESA $\Phi$-Sat-1, and $\Phi$Sat-2, and CogniSat-6 (proprietary satellite). In this keynote, David Rijlaarsdam will share Ubotica's vision on challenges and perspectives related to the use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence solutions in spacecraft missions.
