\subsubsection{Background}
The space sector is characterized by significant growth due to substantial investment and technology advancements. Areas like Earth Observation (EO), space situational awareness, telecommunication, space exploration have witnessed a remarkable expansion. 

In this scenario, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a pivotal role in unlocking novel commercial and  operational mission paradigms thanks to its unprecedented capabilities to enhance spacecraft and satellites' automation, process vast amount of space-borne data and extract actionable information. Examples of applications enabled by AI include autonomous and intelligent rovers for planetary explorations, onboard payload data processing for low-latency deliverable of actionable information from EO satellites, detection of exoplanets from scientific mission data, among others.

Despite these advancements, several technical challenges remain that hinder AI application in space. These include fundamental difficulties in vision and learning for space (\eg, lack of training data, unknown operating environments), limited computing resources and energy budget, harsh operative environment (radiation, extreme temperatures).
